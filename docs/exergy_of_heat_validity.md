# Exergy of Heat Validity Rules (Frozen)

Shortcut formula:
Ex = Q * (1 - T0 / Tb)

This shortcut is allowed ONLY if:
- A single boundary temperature Tb is meaningful
- Tb > T0

Refusal rules:
- If Tb <= T0 → computation must refuse

Limitations (must be documented with results):
- Temperature glide during heat delivery
- Heat exchanger approach temperatures
- Averaging assumptions for Tb
